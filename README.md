# Image-Compression-using-2D-DWT
mplemented a simple 2D Haar Transform to compress 256 Ã— 256 images and used IDWT for reconstruction. Processed images with MATLAB/Python &amp; performed Static Timing Analysis with Quartus TimeQuest. Tested the design on a MAX10 FPGA and carried out hierarchical ASIC design flow using Openlane
